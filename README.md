Lora Weight Sliders and Prompt History
# Stable Diffusion Webui Extension: A simple history and Lora Weights slider. 

I piggybacked it on the simple history slider
https://github.com/LucasMali/sd-history-slider

Similarly to that have DrawThings.ai but for AUTOMATIC 1111 Stable Diffusion Webui.


## What can it do?

- It will track both prompt and negative prompt history for txt2img and img2img.
- It will allow a user to load the history stored on local storage. (I had hidden the button)
- It will allow a user to clear the prompt history.

- my additions
- first three loras used in prompt will have attached slider and moving the slider will change the lora weights

## TODO
- Put a max threshold on the prompt's history.
